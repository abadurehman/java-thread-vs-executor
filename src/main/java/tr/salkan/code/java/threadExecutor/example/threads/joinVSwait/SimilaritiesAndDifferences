Difference between wait() and join() method

		Most obvious difference, both are present different packages, the wait() method is declared in java.lang.Object class while join() is declared in java.lang.Thread class.
		The wait() is used for inter-thread communication while the join() is used for adding sequencing between multiple threads, one thread starts execution after first thread execution finished.
